## About Me

I am Kokila Perera, an undergraduate at NSBM Green University pursuing a BSc (Honours) in Computer Security in partnership with Plymouth University. I am passionate about the field of cybersecurity‚Äîparticularly ethical hacking‚Äîand I am continually seeking hands-on experience to deepen my technical expertise.

In addition to my core academic focus, I have a strong interest in frontend web design using HTML and CSS, and I take pride in developing clean, user-friendly interfaces. I am also actively engaged in research and report writing, especially in areas related to security, data analysis, and emerging technologies.

Currently, I am seeking internship or job opportunities related to computer security and cybersecurity. I am also open to broader IT-related roles that will allow me to apply and expand my technical and analytical skill set.

Driven by curiosity, initiative, and a strong work ethic, I remain committed to growing both professionally and personally as I work toward a career at the forefront of the cybersecurity industry.
